## What is Pig Latin?
Pig Latin is a constructed language game in which words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules. Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. For example, pig yields igpay, banana yields ananabay, and trash yields ashtray or rashtay (dependent on location/preferences).
